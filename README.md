# NebulousConquestHelper

This is a tool to store information about the Nebulous Community Conquest. It provides a way for players to access game info and for GMs to submit orders and advance turns.
Information is stored in XML files, some of which correspond to in-game fleets and ship designs and can be seamlessly imported into the game.
The primary method of interaction with this tool is intended to be through a Discord bot.
