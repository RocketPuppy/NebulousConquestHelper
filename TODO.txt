- implement fleet merging and split offs with the program generating new .fleet files
- implement restocking of missiles/ammo at supply depots
	 - no stockpiling of munitions, resources converted directly upon request
- implement ship repairs at supply depots
	 - infinite ships that can be docked
	 - limited amount of work per ship per turn
	 - no queue, all ships worked on at once
- probably swap the whole thing over to a GM-run local program rather than a discord bot
- implement different kinds of mapmodes for the map printer (fleets present, fuel present, resource satisfaction, etc)
- autogenerate 'info packages' for each team at the conclusion of each turn (fleets, resources, war progress, etc)
- allow teams to toggle increased production at a location in exchange for war progress loss multiplier
