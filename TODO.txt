- implement loc-to-loc transfer of resources
	 - teams can set the amount of requested resources at each loc
	 - the requested amount minus what's already there is the transport need
	 - all locations' transport needs summed up must be lower than the team transport capacity
	 - the transport needs of a specific resource must be lower than the available stock
	 - to advance the turn, teams must set their locations' requested amounts to satisfy these conditions
- implement fleet merging and split offs with the program generating new .fleet files
- implement restocking of missiles/ammo at supply depots
	 - no stockpiling of munitions, resources converted directly upon request
- implement ship repairs at supply depots
- probably swap the whole thing over to a GM-run local program rather than a discord bot
- implement different kinds of mapmodes for the map printer (fleets present, fuel present, resource satisfaction, etc)
- autogenerate 'info packages' for each team at the conclusion of each turn (fleets, resources, war progress, etc)
- allow teams to toggle increased production at a location in exchange for war progress loss multiplier
